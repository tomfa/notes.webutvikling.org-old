Every company needs to send some emails, but which email provider do I use?.

I want high deliverability. Which in turn leads to the following requirements:
- Inbound email routing
- DKIM and SPF support

_(I don't have enough volume or regularity to warrant a [dedicated IP](https://www.shiftparadigm.com/insights/dedicated-vs-shared-ip-how-they-affect-email-deliverability/))_

For transactional emails, I'd want:

- Email template editor, so developers aren't involved in text edits.
- Pass template variables in API calls, preferably with validation.

For marketing emails, It would be nice if it could:
- Handle unsubscribing/resubscribing
- Automation workflows, e.g. send welcome email 1 day after signup
- Automated A/B testing of subject lines


GDPR compliance is a must, and I believe integrattons with [Facebook Audiences](https://www.mailerlite.com/integrations/facebook-audiences)
is massively useful for marketing? (But I also don't want to give Meta money)

Mailerlite (from 9$ or 19$ for my use case) is a **marketing-email service**,
with a sister-company MailerSend to handle transactional emails. It has a Facebook
marketer integration, helping you target similar customers ✅. It's based in EU ✅

71% 5-stars, 24% 1-stars [on Trustpilot](https://no.trustpilot.com/review/mailerlite.com).
The main reason for bad reviews are strict policies ✅, and technical issues ❌.

Mailersend (from 25$ for my use calse) seems like a very well made, easy to use

## [Activecampaign](https://www.activecampaign.com/)

Gives off a more marketing vibe than I'd want.
Custom domain starts at "Contact sales" pricing, which kind of disqualifies it for transactional stuff ❌

## [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)

Mailchimp has been a big name in email for a long time. Unfortunately, they still
process all emails in US only ❌ (though they [claim to be GDPR complaint](https://mailchimp.com/help/mailchimp-european-data-transfers/) still),
and their [Trustpilot](https://no.trustpilot.com/review/www.mailchimp.com) reviews stink .

## [Sendgrid](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/sendgrid.com)

Like Mailchimp, Sendgrid has been a big name in email for a while. Similarily, they still
process all emails in US only ❌ (though they [claim to be GDPR complaint](https://sendgrid.com/resource/general-data-protection-regulation-2/) still),
and their [Trustpilot](https://no.trustpilot.com/review/www.sendgrid.com) reviews stink even worse than Mailchimps.
