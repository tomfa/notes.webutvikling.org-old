From time to time, I'd like to see how the performance gain/loss was after a code change. Say I've updated locahost:8000/search and I'd like to do 100 http calls to localhost:8000/search?q=fish to see how it performs:

1.  Save the file below as **benchmark.sh**

```bash
#!/bin/sh
iterations=$1
url=$2

echo "Running $iterations iterations for curl $url"
totaltime=0.0

for run in $(seq 1 $iterations)
do
 time=$(curl $url \
    -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}")
 totaltime=$(echo "$totaltime" + "$time" | bc)
done

avgtimeMs=$(echo "scale=4; 1000*$totaltime/$iterations" | bc)

echo "Averaged $avgtimeMs ms in $iterations iterations"
```

2\. Run with the following command

```bash
sh benchmark.sh 10 http://google.com
```

3\. Output

```
Running 10 iterations for curl http://google.com
..........
Averaged 88.0227 ms in 10 iterations
```
