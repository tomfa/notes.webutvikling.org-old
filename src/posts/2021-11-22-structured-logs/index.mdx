Structured logging (typically with JSON) instead of plain text is pretty much
required if you want to use log for anything useful besides local debugging.

## What to use logging for

Logging is used to find answers for questions for internal use, unlike most stored files or database data which is 
used to provide features and information to end users.

Logging can give answers to *(by containing)*

- Why something is in the state it is *(what was changed, when and by who)*
- Who has accessed sensitive data *(what was read, when and by who)*
- How are we progressing on business metrics *(products sold, payment amount, signup, userId, cancellation)*
- Where are there an issue, and what was the context *(url paths, query params, http status codes, request ids, response time)*

## Suggested structure

`gist:668a1a4b07f01e112667cbe629d33a92#types.ts`

## Examples

Application logging examples, and examples on use cases for the logged info. 
`createdAt`, `userId` and `requestId` is excluded here, and expected to be added by a log middleware. 

Unlike application logs, HTTPLogs are typically automatically logged on each request by the web server (not our application). We often have little control over these

### Who has accessed sensitive data?

> User 12345 reads their own medical journal.

```ts
Logger.info('Read user journal', {
  action: 'READ_JOURNAL',
  value: 'user:12345',
})

/* Logs 
{ 
   level: "info", 
   message: "Read user journal", 
   createdAt: 1637594905976,
   action: "READ_JOURNAL", 
   value: "user:12345",
   userId: "12345",
   requestId: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
} 
*/
```

- You can use this to detect users who access abnormal amounts of journals by counting `action="READ_JOURNAL"`, grouping by `userId`.
- You can find who has access patient 12345s journals by filtering on `value="user:12345", action="READ_JOURNAL"`.
- If the suspected user denies any knowledge, you can search for HTTP logs with same `requestId`, and read out `ipAddress` to find the IP of the user who did it and its timestamp, which should be sufficient information in case there's a legal inquiery.

### How are we progressing on sales?

> User 12345 completes purchase of 2 x Sunscreen 500ml

```ts
Logger.info('Purchase completed', {
   action: 'PURCHASE_COMPLETED',
   value: order.id,
   userId: '12345',
   monetaryValue: 100000,
})
productsPurchase.forEach(product => 
   Logger.info(`'Purchase item ${product.name}'`, {
      action: 'PURCHASED_ITEM',
      value: product.id,
      userId: '12345',
      quantity: product.quantity,
      monetaryValue: product.price * product.quantity,
   })
)

/* Logs 
{ 
   level: "info", 
   message: "Purchase completed", 
   createdAt: 1637594905976,
   action: "PURCHASE_COMPLETED", 
   value: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
   monetaryValue: 100000,
   userId: "12345",
   requestId: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
} 
{ 
   level: "info", 
   message: "Purchased item Sunscreen 500ml", 
   createdAt: 1637594905977,
   action: "PURCHASED_ITEM", 
   value: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
   quantity: 2,
   monetaryValue: 100000,
   userId: "12345",
   requestId: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
} 
*/
```

- You can create a time series of sales revenue, by aggregation monetaryValue of logs with `action="PURCHASE_COMPLETED"`.
- You can use this to find your best customers by aggregating `monetaryValue` and sorting by `userId`
- You can create a table of products sorted by the amount of revenue it generates.

### When was something changed.

For certain systems, it may be necessary to have logging on most changes to add tracability or accountability. In these cases
it can also be useful for the user to add a comment to why they performed a certain action.

> Employee deletes a user after a request to be deleted ([Right to be forgotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten)).

```ts
Logger.info('User deleted', {
  action: 'DELETE',
  model: 'user'
  value: '22222',
  comment: 'User requested to be deleted support email #1234'
})

/* Logs 
{ 
   level: "info", 
   message: "User deleted", 
   createdAt: 1637594905976,
   action: "DELETE", 
   model: "user",
   value: "22222",
   userId: "12345",
   comment: "User requested to be deleted support email #1234",
   requestId: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
} 
*/
```

### Where can/should we improve performance

If not logged, performance issues are sneaky. Application performance typically decrease over time, as data payloads gets heavier, use increases and features + libraries are added.

With the `HTTPLog` structure logged on each request, we can

- Spot performance issues by adding a time series of `responseTime`.
- Identify which endpoints are slow by grouping by `path` and aggregating e.g. median and 95% percentiles of `responseTime`.
- Identify which endpoints are collectively waited for the most, by aggregating sum of `responseTime`, grouped by `path`.
- Find which parts of a request is slow by creating a timeline of events with the same `requestId`.

### Where are the errors?

Given that your API use HTTP status codes properly or logs status codes from GraphQL requests, you can easily identify problem urls.
If you use an error tracker (e.g. Sentry) where requestIds are sent as error context to tracker, investigating errors becomes a lot easier too.

With the mentioned setup, you could:

- Find which endpoints errors the most by filtering http logs by `httpStatus=500` and grouping by `path`.
- Investigate a Sentry issue by filtering log events on `requestId`.
- Identify hack attempts by creating a timeseries of `httpStatus=401`.
- Find bad links by filtering on `httpStatus=404` and grouping by `path`
- Discover potential misconfiguration by filtering or creating timeseries of `httpStatus=400`

## About privacy

Logs are less secure than database values, as they go through third party libraries in a predictable pattern and are often sent to third party log aggregation vendors, in addition to the host provider.
Therefore, logs should not contain personal information, which is why userId (and not name, email etc.) is added to the `ApplicationLog` above.

## About requestId

The purpose of a requestId is the ability to trace a request logged from the client, to all APIs that serve that request.
Some typical rules of thumbs when setting up support for request ids are:

- The requestId should ideally be sent from the client, using a `X-Request-ID` http header. This is usually required for it to be included in your HTTPLog.
- The API should read and use that request ID (or generate one if not present) on each incoming request.
- The requestId should be used in all logging that handles the given request.

These rules applies for the communication between the app client and the API, but also between internal APIs.
