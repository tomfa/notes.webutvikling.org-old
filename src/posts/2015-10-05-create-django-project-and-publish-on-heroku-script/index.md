It has happened on more than one occasion that I want a new Django project, with Grunt, jQuery, Bootstrap, Font-Awesome etc, deployed on Heroku. So I decided to write down the steps, and made a bash script to automate it all for me. 

It's available at [tomfa.github.io/herango-bash/](http://tomfa.github.io/herango-bash/). 

**Requirements:**

*   Have got an [Heroku Account](https://www.heroku.com/)
*   Have got [brew installed](http://brew.sh/)
*   Have got [Git set up with keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)

If anything else is missing, the script should complain.
