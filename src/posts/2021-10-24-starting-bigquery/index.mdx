Notes made while using Google BigQuery for the first time. This includes creating my first BigQuery table, importing via python, queries, deletion and altering table schemas.

## Creating a BigQuery project

See the ["Before you begin" section in BigQuery Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries#before-you-begin)

In short, these are the steps

- Create a Google Cloud project
- Enable the BigQuery API.
- Create a service account and download a service account key


## Importing data from Python to a BigQuery table

### Installing requirements

Install dependencies from the file below by running
```bash
# preferably do this in a local virtualenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`gist:9492ac855ad0095a5e595822d5aada75#requirements.txt`

Now, either paste your downloaded service account json into the file below,
or export it as an env var ala

```bash
export SA_ACCOUNT='{
  "type": "service_account",
  "...etc"
}'
```

You can then run the file below with

```bash
python bigquery_import.py
```

`gist:9492ac855ad0095a5e595822d5aada75#bigquery_import.py`


## Selecting, updating and deleting BigQuery data

BigQuery can be [queried with SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/enabling-standard-sql).
Queries can be run via an interactive console in the browser, or via libraries as shown below.

### With interactive console
See [Running interactive queries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries)

The queries are similar to SQL.

For instance, querying data
```sql
SELECT * FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable
  WHERE first_name = 'Tomas';
```

...deleting data...
```sql
DELETE FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable
  WHERE first_name = 'Tomas';
```

...or updating:
```sql
UPDATE myproject.mydataset.mytable
  SET last_name = 'Newname'
  WHERE first_name = 'Tomas';
```

### Via a library

The queries can be sent via the library client too:

```python
# python
client = get_client();
query = """
    SELECT name, SUM(number) as total_people
    FROM `your-project.dataset.table_name`
    WHERE state = 'TX'
    GROUP BY name, state
    ORDER BY total_people DESC
    LIMIT 20
"""
query_job = client.query(query)

```

## Modifying table schemas

Only [three modifications can be made to the table schema](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/managing-table-schemas).

- Adding columns to a schema definition
- Deleting, or dropping, a column from a schema definition
- Relaxing a column's mode from REQUIRED to NULLABLE

### Dropping column

Dropping columns can be done via the [interactive console](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries).

```sql
ALTER TABLE your-project.dataset.table_name
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS NAME
```

### Adding column

Via the [interactive console](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries)

```sql
ALTER TABLE your-project.dataset.table_name
  ADD COLUMN NAME STRING
```

or via the library

```python
table_id = "your-project.dataset.table_name"
table = client.get_table(table_id)

original_schema = table.schema

# Creates a copy of the schema.
new_schema = original_schema[:]
new_schema.append(
    bigquery.SchemaField("phone", "STRING")
)

table.schema = new_schema
table = client.update_table(table, ["schema"])

print("A new column has been added.")
```
