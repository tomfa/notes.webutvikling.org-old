_Unless you have got special needs, choose 1Password as your team password manager. It just works, bug free – and their users love them._

----

### Intro

At work, we're in a situation where we want a password manager for ~70 people. Previously, we've set up 
[Passbolt Community](https://www.passbolt.com/pricing/pro), which has worked great for tech. And it's free! However, it's not quite polished enough to be adopted
by everyone – there's no mobile app, and the vibe over it that scares away every other non-technical person.

In this review, we considered 1Password Team, 1Password Business, LastPass Team, LastPass Enterprise, LastPass Identity. 

_Passbolt Cloud is not included, though it was considered but quickly disgarded._

### Summary

1Password and LastPass are both good options to gain practical and secure control over your passwords. 
Their prices ranges from ~3.5EUR to 7.5EUR a month per user, depending on what features you need. 
1Password is a tad cheaper, while LastPass has some extra advanced features.

1Password stands out in user friendliness, and support. The [reviews from users](https://www.reddit.com/r/1Password/comments/hc4ih7/considering_leaving_LastPass_1password_vs/) that have tried both, 
[unanimously prefer 1Password](https://www.reddit.com/r/1Password/comments/lsd5j6/1password_vs_LastPass/). 

> Skip LastPass. It's easily the worst major pw manager out there

> Long time LP premium, then Families user. Android autofill has always been spotty, at best. Installed the trial 1P then upgraded to the Family plan. Everything that I have done, whether I had to dig to figure it out (my brain is slower than normal these days) or it was intuitive, EVERY SINGLE THING WORKS BETTER FOR ME NOW.

> I used LastPass for a few years, originally paid for it back when you had to for mobile sync and then stopped paying for it when they added it to the free plan. I left LastPass a little over a year ago for 1Password and have never looked back.

I did not find anyone recommending LastPass over 1Password, which aligns well with my personal experience (I've tried my best to stay unbiased.)

### Criterias

#### Price
Price obviously matters. 5EUR per user per month, quickly becomes several thousand euros per year.

#### Does it have a mobile application?
We need passwords while we're outside of the office, not necessarily near a computer.
All candidates had this, so it's excluded in the summaries below.

#### User friendliness
UX is very important for security. Many people are relaxed when it comes to passwords. 
If it's easier to put a note with the password next to your screen, many will. 
We'll consider 

- App ratings: what ratings are given to the apps in the App store / Play store
- Biometric login: Can we use our fingerprint instead of an long password?
- Forum reviews: What are people saying online

#### Offboarding a user
Can a super-admin role easily add and remove a user from the system?

#### Are we warned of breaches?
If Dropbox has a breach, will our password manager know and warn us about that for our Dropbox password?

#### Auditing
Can we audit who has done what? Especially: who used that password at a given hour or day if something goes wrong.

#### Can we have federated login / provision users?
Could we automatically invite and remove users based on who got an email in our Gsuite? 

#### Can we give groups access to "folders" of passwords?
All candidates had the ability to create "password folders", which one could manually invite certain users to. 
But in a large organization, this can become a bit of a hassle: for each on- and offboarding, 
we would have to add them to every single "password folder" they belong to.

Is there a way to add new users to group X, and give group X access to folders A, B and C?
