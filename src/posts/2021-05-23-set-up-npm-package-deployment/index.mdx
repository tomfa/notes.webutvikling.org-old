[Semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) can help me follow semantic versioning and create changelogs without me having to do much thinking.

If I also use [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) or [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), I (and my team) can feel safe that the changelogs and version numbers include and respect our changes.

Adding [Github actions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/recipes/github-actions.md) or another CI setup allows us to forget all about it, and just churn out code ðŸ’Œ

## How to set it up.

TLDR: See the [gist](https://gist.github.com/tomfa/be73276aaa2d4f54f56da5f9d8fb092b).

### 1. Install commitlint (+ husky)

```bash
yarn add -D husky @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli
echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > commitlint.config.js
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no-install commitlint --edit "$1"'
```

### 2. Add semantic-release

```bash
# If in monorepo, run this next to the related package.json
npx semantic-release-cli setup
```

This updates our package.json. See resulting [package.json here](https://gist.github.com/tomfa/be73276aaa2d4f54f56da5f9d8fb092b#file-package-json).

### 3. Add CI release

Below is the github action workflow for my current project. Remember to run any tests first, and any build step if you got them.

See gist for [.github/workflows/release.sdk](https://gist.github.com/tomfa/be73276aaa2d4f54f56da5f9d8fb092b#file-github_slash_workflows_slash_release-sdk).
