Case: I have some frontend app that consists of static files, e.g. a React app packed with WebPack. I want to deploy it to S3, with CloudFront in front of it. (Optional) I also want index.html to be rendered when other paths are requested (such as /food/cake-is-best), and for the site to return 200 status instead of 404.

### Setup AWS + terraform

1.  You [sign up](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with Amazon if you haven't already.

2.  Create a secret key / access key pair from [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential).

3.  [Download](https://terraform.io/downloads.html) Terraform, and extract the files to e.g.
    ```bash
    ~/bin/terraform/<files>
    ```
4.  Add the path to your path by adding this line to _~/.bash_profile_
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/terraform
    ```

Alright, that should be it. You can confirm that terraform is setup by typing `terraform` in the terminal. It should respond something that seems sensible.

### Short version

_2021 update: Follow the wizard at [ihasabucket.it](https://ihasabucket.it/) to generate terraform files. This supports static pages better, and terraform v0.12+. The code below is written for terraform v0.11-)_

When you have Terraform installed, all you need to do is do the line below. It will prompt you for anything it needs, and set up a buckets on AWS, with Cloudfront caches in front of it to optimize site speed.

```
terraform apply github.com/tomfa/terraform-sandbox/s3-webfiles-with-cloudfront
```

Alternatively, if you want to specify things yourself, see the code below. Replace the marked variables with your desired region and bucket name.

### Long version

```yaml
# Specifies your AWS credentials and region
provider "aws" {
    access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    region = "AWS_REGION"

# OPTIONAL: Specify a user that will be able to upload stuff to bucket

    name = "YOUR-BUCKET-NAME\-user"

# OPTIONAL: Creates keys for that user
resource "aws_iam_access_key" "prod_user" {
    user = "${aws_iam_user.prod_user.name}"
}

# OPTIONAL: Policy for user that allows it to upload

    name = "prod"
    user = "${aws_iam_user.prod_user.name}"

```

### Profit

Alright, you say, but the config file is quite ugly. So, can we extract the variables out of the mess? Yeah, sure. Replace all the red text above with **${var.test_bucket_name} **instead of `YOUR_TEST_BUCKET_NAME` etc. Then create a **variables.tf,** containing

```yaml
variable "aws_region" {}

variable "aws_access_key" {}
variable "aws_secret_key" {}

variable "prod_bucket_name" {}
variable "test_bucket_name" {}
```

You will then be prompted for the variables instead of having to change them in s3.tf. You can also configure the answers to these, by adding the following to **terraform.tfvars**

```yaml
aws_region = "my-aws_region-value"

aws_access_key = "my-aws_access_key-value"
aws_secret_key = "my-aws_secret_key-value"

prod_bucket_name = "my-prod_bucket_name-value"
test_bucket_name = "my-test_bucket_name-value"
```
