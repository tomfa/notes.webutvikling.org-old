This is a 1-2-3 on how to create and publish an app, from the very beginning. It'll skip over most coding stuff, and instead focus on app/play store accounts, approval and publishing.
While this article has Expo/React Native in mind, most parts are identical if you use Flutter or native apps. It's split up in four parts:

1. Prerequisites
2. Creating developer accounts: Google Play + App Store
3. Creating an app
4. Publishing the app

## 1. Prerequisites

- A Google account
- An Apple Id
- A credit card with ~150$

If you want the app to be published by "My AppCompany", you'll also need a legally registered entity for the company.

_In addition to the things above, you'll be asked questions about the app demographic, payment, category etc. So have that in the back of your mind too._

## 2. Creating developer accounts

### Get a website

You'll need a website for the account setup. It must contain:

- Contact information (including email)
- A privacy page (for the app approval process - can be postponed a bit)

### Sign up for Apple Developer

Create an Apple ID if you haven't and  [enroll for Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)

### Sign up for Google Developer

Create a Google Account if you  haven't and [sign up for a PlayStore developer account](https://play.google.com/console)

### 3. Creating an app

You can Create an app, e.g. with [Expo templates](https://github.com/expo/examples).
