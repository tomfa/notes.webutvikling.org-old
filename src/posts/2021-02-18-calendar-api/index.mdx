Say I want a way for users to book a slot in my calendar. It could be for me to demo them my product.

- I want to choose when I'm available, e.g. Monday through Thursday, 08:00 to 12:00.
- I'd like to only let them book in half hour increments, and only half an hour.
- I want it to automatically show up in my Google Calendar.
- I want to anything after 60 days ahead to be disabled for booking.
- I'd want to be able to block out next Thursday for myself, by simply filling the slot in the calendar.

So far, [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) solves this very nicely. It's cheap, easy to use and comes with some neat extra features
like automated Google Hangout link (it's still Corona?). BUT, integrating it with your own webste involves [using their widgets or iframes](https://calendly.stoplight.io/docs/embed-api-docs/docs/A-Getting-Started.md)

### So what if I want 100% control of the UI? 

Then I'd need

- API-ability to fetch available slots.
- API-ability to book a slot.

Which surprisingly [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) hasn't got!.


### And what's my alternatives?

#### SimplyBook.me 

Despite the name, [simplybook.me](https://simplybook.me/en/) offers a lot. It includes a website, payment and gift-cards, mobile apps, social media integrations and marketing tools.

Honestly, it looks pretty sweet. But total overkill for my use. I basically just want a calendar with an API.


#### Dead ends: Cheap Calendly Copies

- [Meetingbird](https://meetingbird.com/) looks to be missing an API. And it got sunset / smoshed into [Frontapp](https://frontapp.com/), which is too much.
- [TidyCal](https://tidycal.com/) looks a bit too shabby. And no API? [Appointly](https://appoint.ly/) the same way. A one-pager with gradient colors? I'm a skeptic.
- [Vocus](https://vocus.io/pricing) - more of the same.

_Unrelated thought: Subscription-based payments, with a 30 day free trial are a sign of quality. If you want a one-time payment as a 
software, you'll just take my money and run â€“ with no intention of giving support or fixing bugs. You're probably selling a polished turd._

#### Google Calendar API

HOW HARD COULD IT BE?... I'm just going to get -one- calendar. And check availability. And create booking. Maybe add a video link and some attendees? It'll be easy, right?

- [Google has a quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/nodejs)
- [Google has a 74MB(!) package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/googleapis)
- [Neal got exactly what I need](https://neal.codes/blog/google-calendar-api-on-g-suite)
- [Jason has an article](https://medium.com/@jason_dark/google-calendar-api-connect-using-node-js-and-an-api-key-94c12057b330)
- [Martee got some code using a service account](https://dev.to/maartennnn/google-calendar-integration-with-nodejs-without-oauth-2-0-5256)
- [Melvin made it happen](https://hackernoon.com/my-journey-integrating-google-calendar-g-suite-in-node-62fbc8596455)


#### Yes!

- [We need to open up sharing](https://neal.codes/blog/google-calendar-api-on-g-suite)

Because service account is considered outside org.

#### Sending invites to users

Add an attendee to your calendar event.

```ts
const attendees: Schema$EventAttendee[] = [{ email: "user@gmail.com" }];
const params: Params$Resource$Events$Insert = {
    calendarId: 'hello@mybusiness.com',
    requestBody: {
        start: {
          dateTime: new Date().toISOString(),
          timeZone: 'UTC',
        },
        end: {
          dateTime: new Date(new Date().getTime()+3600*1000).toISOString(),
          timeZone: 'UTC',
        },
        attendees: attendees,
        summary: 'Let us talk',
        status: 'confirmed',
        description: 'There is this thing that we need to resolve',
      },
    }
}
cal.events.insert(params, (err, event) => {
  if (err) {
    return reject(err);
  }
  console.log(event.data);
});
```

**Note: You will need "Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority"** for your service user before this works, or else you'll run into

> Service accounts cannot invite attendees without Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority.

#### Adding a Video link

```ts
const attendees: Schema$EventAttendee[] = [{ email: "user@gmail.com" }];
const params: Params$Resource$Events$Insert = {
    calendarId: 'hello@mybusiness.com',
    requestBody: {
        start: {
          dateTime: new Date().toISOString(),
          timeZone: 'UTC',
        },
        end: {
          dateTime: new Date(new Date().getTime()+3600*1000).toISOString(),
          timeZone: 'UTC',
        },
        attendees: attendees,
        summary: 'Let us talk',
        status: 'confirmed',
        description: 'There is this thing that we need to resolve',
      },
    }
}
cal.events.insert(params, (err, event) => {
  if (err) {
    return reject(err);
  }
  console.log(event.data);
});
```
