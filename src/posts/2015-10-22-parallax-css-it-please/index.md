Parallax is hot. But in so many implementations, it's not. Because it's implemented shittily.

1.  Parallax shouldn't be done with Javascript, because then it might end up like [this](http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrolldeck.js/decks/parallax/): so laggy it breaks my heart.
2.  It should be done with [CSS](http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/demo3-webkit-overflow-fix/).
