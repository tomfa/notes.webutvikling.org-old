This post summarizes a frustrating limitation in Firebase that limits inequality filters, and how I ended up working around it.

### Goal

- Being able to add a Comment to a Post.
- Retrieve a list of most commented posts, created this week.

### Problem

> [If you include a filter with a range comparison (<, <=, >, >=), your first ordering must be on the same field](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/query-data/order-limit-data#limitations)

Which means that when I naively run my query below, I end up with an error saying

> Inequality filter property and first sort order must be the same: createdAt and numComments

##### Naive unsupported query

```ts
// This won't work
const query = firestore
      .collection('posts')
      .orderBy('numComments', 'desc')
      .where('createdAt', '>', '2021-09-01')
```

### Context

#### Firebase: data modelling

Our Posts is a (root-level) Collection in Firebase, with Comments being a SubCollection under each post.

_[Google: Firebase data structures](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/structure-data)_


#### Firebase: calculating number of  comments

Where we in Postgres could count number of references from a Comment table, there is no api for finding number of Comments
for a Post.

The way to solve it _(without having to read the entire subcollection)_, is to add a field on Post and increment it when adding a new Comment.

```ts
const postRef = firestore
  .collection('posts')
  .doc(postId);

const commentRef = postRef
  .collection('comments')
  .doc('new-random-id');

const comment = {
  // comment to add
};

await firestore.runTransaction(
  async (transaction) => {
    transaction.update(postRef, {
      numComments: FieldValue.increment(1),
    });
    transaction.set(commentRef, data);
    return data;
  })
```

#### Firebase: Adding date subfields

Now comes the frustration: I can't order by `numComments`, while also filtering by date greater (or less) than.

To work around this, I'm adding new date-related fields to the Post: `createdAtYear`, `createdAtMonth` and `createdAtWeek`. 

I can then approximate my previous query with

```ts
const query = firestore
      .collection('posts')
      .orderBy('numComments', 'desc')
      .where('createdAtYear', '==', 2021)
      .where('createdAtWeek', '==', 39)
```

Obviously, this is no where near as flexible as having a greater-than filter. If I'd want to serve last 12 months for instance, 
I'd have to query for last year + this year, and filter out the too-old posts client side.


#### Sidenote: Firebase pagination

Pagination is done with 

```ts
const query = firestore
      .collection('posts')
      .orderBy('numComments', 'desc')
      // ....
      .startAfter(cursor)
```

Note that the cursor have to match the value of the first orderBy clause. In the example above, `cursor` must be a number.

If you have multiple `orderBy`, you can specify them all there, in the same order.

```ts
const query = firestore
      .collection('posts')
      .orderBy('numComments', 'desc')
      .orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
      // ....
      .startAfter(lastResultNumComments, lastResultCreatedAt)
```

For this reason, it's a good idea to have the last result when doing pagination (rather than just the value of a certain field).
