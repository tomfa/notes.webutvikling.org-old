I recently bought a Macbook Pro Retina (Late 2014) with 128 GB of storage. I thought that if I needed 256 GB, I could just buy a regular SSD and swap them. Turns out i can't. Or.. I can, but it's a special SSD that costs a third of a new Mac. And I just bought one! I can't even afford milk! Anyhow, here's a **list of software that I "need" **as a software kind of guy:

- [Slack](http://slack.com) - the best team communication platform
- [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) - having my data stored safely is just really neat. Also need it for collaboration some times
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) - same as with Dropbox.
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - best editor.
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - best 'heavy' python editor.
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - best 'heavy' javascript editor.
- [TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com) \- Honestly just for cmd-x to cut
- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) - I don't have words. It's an awesome utility must-have.
- [1Pass](https://agilebits.com/) - Never have to remember passwords again.
- [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com) - window manager for OS X.
- [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/) - Talking with people (though I try to use [appear.in](http://appear.in) when possible)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/no/) - Musicplayer
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Making sketches and mockups for costumers
- [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) - Adjusts the screen lightning to make late night coding more pleasant
- [FileZilla](http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/) - FTP Client
- [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) - SQL client
- [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) - need it for all these awesome things
  - _brew install git_
  - _brew install node_
  - _npm install -g grunt-cli gulp_
