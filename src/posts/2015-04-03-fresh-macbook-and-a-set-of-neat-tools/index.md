I recently bought a Macbook Pro Retina (Late 2014) with 128 GB of storage. I thought that if I needed 256 GB, I could just buy a regular SSD and swap them. Turns out i can't. Or.. I can, but it's a special SSD that costs a third of a new Mac. And I just bought one! I can't even afford milk! Anyhow, here's a **list of software that I "need" **as a software kind of guy:

*   [Slack](http://slack.com) - the best team communication platform
*   [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) - having my data stored safely is just really neat. Also need it for collaboration some times
*   [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) - same as with Dropbox.
*   [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - best editor.
*   [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - best 'heavy' python editor.
*   [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - best 'heavy' javascript editor.
*   [TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com) \- Honestly just for cmd-x to cut
*   [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) - I don't have words. It's an awesome utility must-have.
*   [1Pass](https://agilebits.com/) - Never have to remember passwords again.
*   [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com) - window manager for OS X.
*   [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/) - Talking with people (though I try to use [appear.in](http://appear.in) when possible)
*   [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/no/) - Musicplayer
*   [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Making sketches and mockups for costumers
*   [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) - Adjusts the screen lightning to make late night coding more pleasant
*   [FileZilla](http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/) - FTP Client
*   [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) - SQL client
*   [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) - need it for all these awesome things
    *   _brew install git_
    *   _brew install node_
    *   _npm install -g grunt-cli gulp_
