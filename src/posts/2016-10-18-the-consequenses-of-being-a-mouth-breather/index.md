The title is actually meant literally. I've come to some unscientific conclusions about the effect of breathing through your mouth rather than your nose, using only anecdotal evidence. Bear with me. I wonder why "mouth-breather" is used for calling someone retarded. It gives you less cavities Cavities are due to sugar and not brushing your teeth, we're being told. And that's pretty much true. But directly, it's caused by sulfuric acid corroding your teeth. This acid is a byproduct of anaerobic bacteria eating sugar in your mouth. Less sugar = less anaerobic bacteria = less acid = less cavaties. Anaerobic bacteria are those that thrive without oxygen, living of the energy from converting sugar (C6H12O6 -> 2 x C3H6O6), as It gives you better breath It will make your lips dry Will change the noise you make when you sleep
