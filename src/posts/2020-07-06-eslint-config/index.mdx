I like eslint. But I don't quite understand how the setup works. Let's learn it!

## Installation

Getting Started with ESLint tells us to go get started with:

```bash
# Install eslint
yarn add -D eslint

# Set up config
yarn run eslint --init
```

This will prompt me with a little set of questions. I'll mark my suggested defaults with _italic_.

**How would you like to use ESLint?**
- To check syntax only
- To check syntax and find problems
- _To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style_

Reasoning: Consistency is king!

**What type of modules does your project use?**
- _JavaScript modules (import/export)_
- CommonJS (require/exports)
- None of these

Depends on my project.

**Which framework does your project use?**
- _React_
- Vue.js
- None of these

Depends on my project.

**Does your project use TypeScript?**  No / Y

Depends on my project.

**Where does your code run?**
- _Browser_
- _Node_

Depends on my project.

**How would you like to define a style for your project?**
- _Use a popular style guide_
- Answer questions about your style
- Inspect your JavaScript file(s)

Reasoning: Using a popular lint config usually has more sensible defaults than what I'll come up with myself.

**Which style guide do you want to follow?**
- _Airbnb: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript_
- Standard: https://github.com/standard/standard
- Google: https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google

It's just what I'm used to.

**What format do you want your config file to be in?**
- _JavaScript_
- YAML
- JSON

Javascript allows us to do some extra imports or logic if need be.

This will install the needed depencies. If I look at my new `package.json`, I'll see some new eslint packages in my devDepencencies. 

### Running eslint

I can run a check with:
```bash
yarn run eslint .
```

And fix (some problems) with
```bash
yarn run eslint . --fix
```

## Understanding the config

Let's go through each part of my newly generated `.eslintrc.js`:

```js
env: {
  browser: true,
  es2020: true,
},
```
The [env](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-environments) section tells eslint something about the environment I'm in. _browser_ implies I should be able to use `window` (available in browser), rather than `fs` (available in _node_). `es2020` declares that I should be able to use any part of the `es2020` javascript standard.

```js
extends: [
  'plugin:react/recommended',
  'airbnb',
],
```

[Extends](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#using-a-configuration-file) allows us to point to a different eslint configuration, and use that as a "basis". The current eslint config will take presendence over any configuration it extends. 

I can point to packages such as `eslint-config-airbnb`, or with a relative path to a different config file of my own. That allows me to split up rules and settings in different files, which can be useful if I want to reuse my rules accross different repositories. 

_Note: When pointing to packages, I can omit `eslint-config`, and only write `airbnb` as the extended package string._

```js
parserOptions: {
  ecmaFeatures: {
    jsx: true,
  },
  ecmaVersion: 11,
  sourceType: 'module',
},
```

[parserOptions](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-parser-options) tells eslint about ECMA options: if we use `import` vs `require` in imports, which version and features we got.


```js
plugins: [
  'react',
],
```

[plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-parser-options) can preprocess files, or add extra rules to choose from.

**Plugins: processor**: to generate javascript to be linted. An example would could be javascript contained within `.md` files. 

The plugins job would then be to extract javascript from the files before eslint lints them.

**Plugins: rules**: `react` in the config above adds [these rule options](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react). By doing so, we do not enforce any rules, we just add them to the set to select from.

We'll have to add them to `extends` or `rules` for us to enforce any of them.


```js
rules: {
  // Your rules go here
},
```

I can override existing rules, or add new rules in rules. [eslint.org/docs/rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) provides a list of available rules, and reasoning and examples behind each of them. 

### Other configuration options
- Ignore files by specifying them in [.eslintignore](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#eslintignore).
- Disallow warnings with `yarn run eslint . --max-warnings=0`
- Configurate for other file endings (e.g. for `.md`) by [specifying processor](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#eslintignore)
