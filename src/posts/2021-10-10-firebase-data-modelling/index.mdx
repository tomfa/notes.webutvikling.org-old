This post summarizes my learnings from the course [Fireship: Firestore data modeling](https://fireship.io/courses/firestore-data-modeling/).

Below are my initial preconceptions about Firebase (in bold), and my conclusions after the course.
I'm using a blog as example, with posts, users and comments.

### The data isn't normalized

**Correct** – since database joins isn't really a thing, you would have to make additional queries to fetch related data.
Data are therefore often duplicated to increase performance and reduce number of queries.

For instance, a post has a user (author). But the post typically won't have a "authorId" field.
Instead, it may have an author "object" field containing the user id, name and username.

Two good rules of thumb are:
- including all data shown about the author in a render of the Post
- not including data that change often

#### Due to denormalization, data is tricker to update

**Correct.** That's why you avoid denormalizing data that update frequently.

When you need to update denormalized data, you need to know all document paths
that lead to this data. Then you can do a multi-path update call to Firestore.

Also see [Firebase (Youtube): Data consistency with multi-path updates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1n9Kw3AORw)

#### Due to denormalization, migrations isn't really a thing

**Correct**, it seems to be manual labour.

Say you want to delete a field "draft" on Post.
You'll have to query for where draft exist, and run delete on each of them.

```ts
import { firestore, doc, updateDoc, deleteField } from "firebase/firestore";

// Add limit() to delete in smaller batches
const posts = await firestore
  .collection('posts')
  // orderBy excludes where draft is missing
  .orderBy('draft')
  .get()

let batch = firestore.batch();

posts.docs.forEach(doc => {
  batch.update(doc.ref, {
    capital: deleteField()
  });
})
await batch.commit();
```

Same applies if you want to update a field or add a field.

and [Firebase (Youtube): Data consistency with multi-path updates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1n9Kw3AORw)_

#### Due to denormalization, I must expect inconsistencies

**Wrong.** You can make atomic changes across multiple documents.
Inconsistencies happen if you do something wrong (which _is_ easier), but
you shouldn't expect it.

### Document databases are better suited for serverless environments

**Yes, absolutely.**

Horizontal scaling is already handled for me. It handles as many connections as you need. It's pay per use from 0 to infinity.
This differs from relational databases which has a pay per capacity, with
a price put on number of connections and slow connection time.

I think this might change in the next few years with services like
[Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/), but [we're
not there yet](/aurora-serverless-is-not-for-your-hobby-project/).

### Data modeling should match the UI
**Somewhat correct.**

The reason that we denormalize data is to reduce number of reads. We don't know
what parts of User to include in Post without knowing how it will be used.

For instance, if the UI will show the full name of an author and image in a list
feed of recent posts, these fields should be included in the Post. If this is only
visible when clicking and reading the Post, you might not include it.

### Pricing starts at 0

**Correct**. Firestore even throws in a hobby based capacity for free.

_See [cloud.google.com/firestore/pricing](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/pricing)_

### When done wrong, can get really expensive

**Correct.** You _can_ write code that ends up in an endless while loops.
And poor code can cost you 1000x as much as good code. How to avoid it
centers around minimizing reads and writes, through correct denormalizing and avoiding excessive updates.

In the Firebase Spark plan, you won't pay anything. But once you need to upgrade,
remember to [set up a budget in GCP](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/avoid-surprise-bills).
